## A bunch of Liferay ModelListener components for listening to content page related events

A bunch of ModelListener components for listening to content page event including creating experiences, page layout changes and the creation of segments.

The module also includes a Notification Handler and examples of me sending notifications via the ModelListeners.

Confirmed to work in Liferay 7.2, but should work in other 7.+ versions.
